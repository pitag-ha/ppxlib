val protect_refs : ref_and_value list -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [protect_refs l f] temporarily sets [r] to [v] for each [R (r, v)] in [l]
    while executing [f]. The previous contents of the references is restored
    even if [f] raises an exception, without altering the exception backtrace.

val create_hashtable: int -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a, 'b) Hashtbl.t
        (* Create a hashtable of the given size and fills it with the
           given bindings. *)

val edit_distance : string -> string -> int -> int option
(** [edit_distance a b cutoff] computes the edit distance between
    strings [a] and [b]. To help efficiency, it uses a cutoff: if the
    distance [d] is smaller than [cutoff], it returns [Some d], else
    [None].

    The distance algorithm currently used is Damerau-Levenshtein: it
    computes the number of insertion, deletion, substitution of
    letters, or swapping of adjacent letters to go from one word to the
    other. The particular algorithm may change in the future.
